Robotic Autiomation Marco Scripts

The purpose of this application is to automate routine tasks done System Admin/ Server Admin

The need of this program, when i faced issues in my work place for MS SQL DB Logs full and the applications hanged.

I initially planned to write a vbscript to hook up with scheduled tasks or to use the ms sql jobs option to set a sql query to truncate sql logs

Later then decided to go for GUI based solution, since my phd project is also related to Robotics Process Automation.
I thought this program will be an example of robotic process which does not have any shape but any process that works automatic is artificial intelligence and robotic process automation, as most of them think the word robotic means a human like machine.

I named if after the tamil word "தானி" (taanee) which means Automatic.

Please feel free your ideas and any features for this application to my email id : me@karthik.sg
Anyone benefit with this application please contribute to my major artificial intelligence project : www.thambi.ai

Due to time constrain this code was forked from automagica and customised to my own needs.
Thanks to automatiga team
